apptmp_rec is the table and app_source is the column.

AEA is the code for adult ed application

select app_source count(app_source) from apptmp_rec group by app_source;


Where are we adding?
    previous_name (see prev_name_id in app_idtmp_rec)
    employer
    position
    reimbursement
    minor
    cert
    military (vet_ben in app_admtmp_rec?)

--- is email field limited to 32 char? ---
see table "app_admtmp_rec"

affirmative: varchar 32

for now, until we can increase the size of that field, use:

email[:32]
